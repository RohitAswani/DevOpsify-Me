# DevOpsify-Me

**DevOpsify-Me** is a project that automates and simplifies DevOps workflows using Docker and CI/CD pipelines. The goal is to make it easier for DevOps engineers to set up, manage, and monitor applications in different environments using modern DevOps tools like Docker, Watchtower, and Docker Compose.

This project includes several Docker-based services that are ready to be used in local or cloud environments. It also integrates with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

## Features

- **Docker Compose Setup**: Easy management of Docker containers using a `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automates building and deploying Docker containers.
- **Service Monitoring**: Integrates Watchtower for automatic container updates.
- **Multi-environment Configuration**: Support for local, staging, and production environments.
- **Health Checks**: Ensures services inside containers are running smoothly.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Integrates with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (optional).
- **Custom Scripts**: Includes automated scripts for various DevOps tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up **DevOpsify-Me** on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/) (Optional, for pushing Docker images)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/) (For CI/CD with GitHub Actions)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DevOpsify-Me.git
    cd DevOpsify-Me
    ```

2. **Create and Configure Environment Files**:
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values for environment-specific settings.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. **Run Docker Compose**:
    - To start the application and services, use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will:
    - Start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    - Run the application and containerized services like web app, database, and monitoring tools.

### Testing

Once the containers are running, you can check the status of the services:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You can also view the logs for the running containers:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Accessing the Web Application
After running docker-compose up -d, the web application should be available at:

http://localhost:5000

Stopping the Containers
To stop the running containers, use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
1. Set Up the GitHub Actions Pipeline:

The project includes a basic GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD, which is located in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

This pipeline builds the Docker images, runs tests, and deploys the application to a specified target (such as AWS, GCP, or Docker Hub).

2. Trigger the Pipeline:

Every push to the repository triggers the pipeline defined in ci.yml.

You can check the pipeline status directly on GitHub under the Actions tab.

Monitoring with Watchtower
Watchtower automatically updates your running containers when new images are pushed to Docker Hub. It ensures that your services are always up to date without manual intervention.

## Troubleshooting
### Common Errors
- Error: no matching manifest for linux/arm64: This error occurs when trying to pull an image not compatible with your system architecture. Ensure the images you are using are compatible with your architecture or build them yourself.

- Error: python: not found: This usually happens if there's a mistake in the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile. Ensure that you are using the correct command to run your application. For example, use python3 instead of python if that‚Äôs the appropriate version on your system.

## Enhancements
- Future enhancements to the DevOpsify-Me project include:

- Adding Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring container health and performance.

- Extending support for Kubernetes (K8s) deployment.

- Integrating security features like image vulnerability scanning using Trivy or Clair.

- Adding a more detailed UI for monitoring and managing containers.
